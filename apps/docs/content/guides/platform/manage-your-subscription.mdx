## About billing on Supabase
Supabase bills separately for each organization. That means that each organization has its own subscription, including a unique plan (Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise), payment method, billing cycle, and invoices.

Different plans cannot be mixed within a single organization. For example, you cannot have both a Pro Plan project and a Free Plan project in the same organization. To have projects on different plans, you must create separate organizations. See [Project Transfers](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer) if you need to move a project to a different organization.

### Credits
Each organization has a credit balance. Credits are applied to future invoices to reduce the amount due. As long as the credit balance is greater than $0, credits will be used before charging your payment method on file.

Your organization gets [credits upon downgrade](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-subscription#credits-upon-downgrade). Besides that you can top up credits any time.

You can find the credit balance on the [organization's billing page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing).

## Change your subscription
You can change your subscription at any time by clicking the "Change subscription plan" button on the [organization's billing page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing).

#### Credits upon downgrade
Upon subscription downgrade, any prepaid subscription fee will be credited back to your organization for unused time in the billing cycle. These credits do not expire and will be applied to future invoices.

**Example:**
If you start a Pro Plan subscription on January 1 and downgrade to the Free Plan on January 15, your organization will receive approximately $12.50 in credits for the unused time between January 15 and January 31.

As stated in our [Terms of Service](https://supabase.com/terms#1-fees), we do not offer refunds to the payment method on file.
